=============

The source code for our [saree website](http://sarees.herokuapp.com/).

Instructions to come eventually. Please don't copy our website.

# Instructions (Incomplete)

### Install Depedencies
First, get nodejs, then run the following command: `npm install -g bower gulp`

Then, run `npm install` and `bower install` to get all the third party libraries.

### Develop
1. Run the following command `gulp serve`.
2. Then, visit `localhost:9000` in your browser, and start editing. When you save your files in any editor, the web page will reload automatically, restarting all your scripts.
3. If you want to do test driven development, start `gulp test`, then visit localhost:9018 in your browser (karma requires the browser to run tests). Note, you can do TDD at the same time as regular development :D
